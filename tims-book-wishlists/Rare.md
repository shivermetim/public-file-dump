║ My go-to site for rare and antique books is  ║
║ www.bookfinder.com. Typically I'm not fussed ║
║ if the book is poor quality, and for the     ║
║ books listed below, I would like originals,  ║
║ not print-on-demand reprints. This is not    ║
║ necessarily the case with antique books in   ║
║ other lists.                                 ║
