Tim's Book Wish List (Rare) 2022.11.12 12:51

!!!note
My go-to site for rare and antique books is www.bookfinder.com. Typically I'm not fussed if the book is poor quality, and for the books listed below, I would like originals, not print-on-demand reprints. This is not necessarily the case with antique books in other lists.
