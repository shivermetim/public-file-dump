## Perameters
### Basic Parameters
* `--aspect` or `--ar:` Change the aspect ratio of a generation. Eg: `--ar 2:3`
  * `--ar 1:1` Default aspect ratio.
  * `--ar 5:4` Common frame and print ratio.
  * `--ar 3:2` Common in print photography.
  * `--ar 7:4` Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.
* `--chaos <number 0‚Äì100>`: Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.
* `--no:` Negative prompting, remove plants from the image.
* `--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>` or `--q <.25, .5, 1, or 2>`: How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.
* `--seed <integer between 0‚Äì4294967295>`: The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the `--seed` or `--sameseed` parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.
* `--stop <integer between 10‚Äì100>`: Use the `--stop` parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.
* `--style <4a, 4b or 4c>`: Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4
* `--stylize <number>` or `--s <number>`: Parameter influences how strongly Midjourney‚Äôs default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.
* `--uplight`: Use an alternative ‚Äúlight‚Äù upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.
* `--upbeta`: Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.
### Model Version Parameters
* `--niji`: An alternative model focused on anime style images.
* `--hd`: Use an early alternative Model that produces larger, less consistent images. This algorithm may be suitable for abstract and landscape images.
* `--test`: Use the Midjourney special test model.
* `--testp`: Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.
* `--version <1, 2, or 3>` or `--v <1 2, or 3>`: Use an earlier version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.
### Upscaler Parameters
* `--uplight`: Use an alternative ‚Äúlight‚Äù upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.
* `--upbeta`: Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.
* `--upanime`: Use an alternative upscaler trained to work with the `--niji` Midjourney Model.
### Other Parameters
* `--creative`: Modify the test and testp models to be more varied and creative.
* `--iw`: Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is `--iw 0.25`.
* `--sameseed`: Seed values create a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. When `--sameseed` is specified, all images

## Control Phrases
* `fine ultra-detailed realistic` - Can be a bit grainy and "ropey" but increases detail generation
* `ultra photorealistic` - Simiar to `fine ultra-detailed realistic`
* `Hasselblad H6D` - Sharper focus on subect; shadows are deepened
* `high definition` - Shadows are lightened; more fanciful and saturated colors
* `8k` - Lighting tends to be more extreme; colors even more saturated and computer-generated looking than "high definition"
* `cinematic` - Shadows tend to be more extreme (though not darker); objects a bit thicker; more poster-like
* `color grading` - Extreme variations in hue; vibrant but not over-saturated colors
* `depth of field` - sharp focus on subject, background and foreground blurred
* `film lighting` - Limited lighting sources; backlighting common; deep shadows cast by light sources
* `rim lighting` - Slighting stronger lighting effect than "film lighting," but very similar results
* `intricate` - Tends toward non-realistic "crafts" and "pattern" type designs.
* `realism` - Aristic realism. Backgrounds tend to be more uniform; subject looks more like a painting; more objects with subject
* `photography` - Subject tends to have a little area of objects around it with little else in the background
* `rendered for IMAX` - More complex subject with very directional lighting and subdued saturation
* `tilt-shift` - Like `depth of field,` but from above or with high angle
* `motion-blur` - Speed lines. May render as if wind is blowing
* `35mm film` - More vibrant colors, but muted saturation, detailed with additional foreground and/or background elements
* `soft focus` - Slight blurry focus and thiner subject with lots of potentially grainy detail; colors tend toward pastels
* `harsh lighting` - Extreme contrast with dark shadows
* `minimalist line art` - Very simplified pen-on-paper type line sketch of the subject with few or no additional elements‚Ä†
* `Hasselblad full frame` - Similar to "35mm film" with more emphasis on strong contrast.
